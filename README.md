What this Pack Contains:

This pack has a full set of digital assets for use in a Solarus quest. It should contain all you need to make your own quest
in a style approximating that of the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, or NES. All sprites and tiles use 2-4 colours (including transparency),
and come with a sample palette for recolourizing them to your liking.
